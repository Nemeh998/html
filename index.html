          <h2>What is HTML? The Basics of Hypertext Markup Language Explained</h2>
          <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs,
            headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.
        
            HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it
            makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
        
            When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page. For example,
            we can create a paragraph by placing the enclosed text within a starting "
          <p> and closing </p> tag.
          </p>
          <h2>HTML Evolution. What Differs Between HTML and HTML5?</h2>
          <p> Since the first days, HTML has gone through an incredible evolution. W3C constantly publish new versions and
            updates, while historical milestones get dedicated names as well.
        
            HTML4 (these days commonly referred to as “HTML”) was published in 1999, while the latest major version came out in
            2014. Named HTML5, the update has introduced many new features to the language.
        
            One of the most anticipated features of HTML5 is native support for audio and video embedding. Instead of using
            Flash player, we can simply embed videos and audio files to our web pages using the new tags. It also includes
            in-built support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) and MathML for mathematical and scientific formulas.
        
            HTML5 introduced a few semantic improvements as well. The new semantic tags inform browsers about the meaning of
            content, which benefits both readers and search engines.
